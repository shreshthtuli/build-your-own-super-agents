    "# 🧠 Agentic Evaluation: From Ground Truth to Continuous Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏁 0. Introduction: Why Evaluate Agents Differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating traditional machine learning models is relatively straightforward: you have **static datasets**, **fixed labels**, and **well-defined metrics** — such as accuracy for classifiers, BLEU for translation, or F1 for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when you move from models to **agents**, this simplicity disappears. Agents are not one-shot predictors — they are **interactive systems** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plan** a sequence of actions toward a goal.\n",
    "* **Perceive** changing environments and update their beliefs.\n",
    "* **Call tools and APIs** (search engines, databases, calculators, etc.).\n",
    "* **Collaborate** with or compete against other agents.\n",
    "* **Reflect** on their own reasoning, memory, and prior outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, an agent’s performance is not only about “what it outputs,” but also **how** and **why** it arrives there — and **how reliably** it behaves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **The Core Challenge**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a model produces one answer, we can check if it’s *correct*. When an agent acts, we must check if it was:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Strategic** – did it follow an effective plan?\n",
    "* **Consistent** – did it behave predictably across contexts?\n",
    "* **Goal-aligned** – did it actually achieve the objective?\n",
    "* **Safe and compliant** – did it avoid unsafe or disallowed actions?\n",
    "* **Efficient** – did it use minimal resources or steps?\n",
    "* **Self-aware** – did it know when it was uncertain or wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, **agentic evaluation** moves beyond correctness to measure **competence, coherence, compliance, and confidence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ **What is Agentic Evaluation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic evaluation is the systematic study of **how well an agent performs as an autonomous decision-maker**.\n",
    "It assesses multiple layers of capability:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Evaluation Dimension    | Core Question                                                                          | Typical Example                                                          | Common Metric                   |\n",
    "| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Component-level**     | Are the internal modules (planner, tool selector, memory retriever) working correctly? | “Did the battle agent pick the correct move calculator tool?”            | Accuracy, precision             |\n",
    "| **End-to-end**          | Does the overall system achieve its intended goal?                                     | “Did the Pokémon agent win the battle?”                                  | Success rate                    |\n",
    "| **Objective**           | How close is the output to the known ground truth?                                     | “Did it pick the move prescribed by the rule book?”                      | F1, BLEU, cosine similarity     |\n",
    "| **Subjective**          | How good is the reasoning or strategy according to a human or LLM judge?               | “Was the battle plan logical and effective?”                             | 1–10 score or preference model  |\n",
    "| **Continuous**          | How does performance evolve over time and across deployments?                          | “Is the new agent version performing better than the previous one?”      | ΔMetric, regression detection   |\n",
    "| **Safety & Robustness** | Does the agent remain aligned with safety policies under attack?                       | “Does it avoid rude or policy-violating text under adversarial prompts?” | Block rate, false-positive rate |\n",
    "\n",
    "These axes together give a **holistic view** of an agent’s reliability, adaptability, and safety — much like how DevOps expanded into **MLOps** and is now evolving into **AgentOps**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 **Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "As agents start integrating into products — from customer service bots to scientific discovery assistants — a single misstep can cause:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Financial or reputational harm** (incorrect trading or betting actions),\n",
    "* **Security risks** (prompt injection, data exfiltration),\n",
    "* **User mistrust** (inconsistent or toxic responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, evaluation must move from being a **static QA step** to a **continuous process** embedded in deployment pipelines — similar to test-driven development (TDD), but for reasoning and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to perform **objective**, **subjective**, and **safety-aware** evaluations of agents, illustrated via a fun, tractable **Pokémon battle environment**.\n",
    "By the end, you’ll have the blueprint for building a **continuous evaluation pipeline** — one that automatically detects regressions, enforces safety, and quantifies confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A barage of work has been done in this field, such as using LLMs as evaluators by [Gu et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15594) or creating agentic benchmarks by [Liu et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03688).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll use a **Pokémon battle agent** to illustrate these ideas — showing how to evaluate its reasoning, action selection, goal success, safety, and confidence, both manually and automatically.\n",
    "By the end, you’ll understand how to design an **agentic evaluation loop** that scales from research prototypes to production-grade AI systems.\n"

    "### 🧩 **Setting Up the Pokémon Evaluation Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin evaluating our agents, we need a simple **simulation environment** that lets them make decisions and receive feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we design a **lightweight Pokémon battle simulator** where each Pokémon has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **type** (e.g., electric, water, fire, grass)\n",
    "* A list of **moves** it can use in battle\n",
    "\n",
    "We also define a minimal **type effectiveness chart** to model how well one Pokémon performs against another — for instance, Electric moves are strong against Water types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `simulate_battle()` acts as the core of our testbed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It lets an **agent function** (our decision-maker) choose moves.\n",
    "* It evaluates the **effectiveness** of those moves based on type matchups.\n",
    "* It returns an **average score** representing the agent’s performance across multiple rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment will serve as a **controlled sandbox** for testing different evaluation strategies — from component-level checks to end-to-end agent performance, safety, and continuous monitoring.\n"

    "* **Structured Outputs with Pydantic:**\n",
    "  We define a `MoveChoice` model that enforces valid Pokémon moves using a `Literal` type — ensuring the LLM never emits invalid or off-schema responses.\n",
    "* **System Prompt as Behavior Guide:**\n",
    "  The `system_prompt` instructs the model to act as a Pokémon strategist, choosing *exactly one* legal move based on type matchups and strategy.\n",
    "* **Reusable Interface:**\n",
    "  The `agentic_planner()` function wraps the LLM call so it behaves like any other agent function (e.g., `simple_planner`), returning a move given a player and opponent.\n",
    "* **Benchmark Integration:**\n",
    "  We evaluate this agent using the **same exhaustive simulator** from before, comparing win rates across all Pokémon matchups.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates how **pydantic-ai bridges reasoning and control** — combining flexible LLM decision-making with reliable, schema-bound outputs for repeatable evaluations."

    "### 💬 **Subjective Evaluation: Using an LLM as a Judge**\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective evaluation (as done in the previous section) relies on **explicit ground truths** — fixed “correct” answers for each Pokémon matchup.\n",
    "But in the real world, **agentic systems rarely have ground truth labels** for every scenario — decisions can be valid in multiple ways depending on strategy, context, or risk preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture this nuance, we now move to **subjective evaluation**, where a **Large Language Model acts as an impartial judge** and scores the agent’s behavior based on qualitative criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Why We Don’t Need Ground Truths Here\n",
    "\n",
    "In subjective testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We don’t predefine “correct” actions.\n",
    "* Instead, we **observe the battle trace** (sequence of moves, turns, and outcomes).\n",
    "* The judge LLM evaluates based on *plausibility*, *coherence*, *effectiveness*, and *policy compliance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows us to evaluate **complex, emergent agent behaviors** that can’t be reduced to simple accuracy metrics — similar to how human evaluators review multi-turn conversations or strategic reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚔️ How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We run both the **simple planner** and a **more advanced agentic planner** through a series of simulated battles.\n",
    "2. Each simulation logs a **battle trace** — a turn-by-turn record of moves, multipliers, and outcomes.\n",
    "3. We feed these textual traces to a **pydantic-ai judge agent**, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Reads the trace (no hidden knowledge of type charts or true answers).\n",
    "   * Scores it on rubrics such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Correctness** – Did the chosen moves contribute to success?\n",
    "     * **Type Optimality** – Were type advantages exploited?\n",
    "     * **Rationale Quality** – Was there apparent strategic reasoning?\n",
    "     * **Policy Compliance** – Did the agent respect behavioral constraints (e.g., “no harsh language”)?\n",
    "   * Computes a weighted **overall score (0–100)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧾 What This Achieves\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluates **strategy quality**, not just correctness.\n",
    "* Works even when **ground truth labels are unknown or multi-valued**.\n",
    "* Enables **rich rubrics and policy evaluation** (e.g., safety, style, ethics).\n",
    "* Mirrors state-of-the-art **LLM-as-a-judge** methods used in open-ended AI benchmarking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📈 Output Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You’ll see a **textual trace** from a sample battle.\n",
    "* The LLM judge will return **rubric scores** (0–10 per criterion) and an **overall composite**.\n",
    "* Aggregated averages will show how each agent type performs qualitatively — often revealing strategic superiority even when quantitative accuracy is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This step completes the transition from **objective** (ground-truth-driven) to **subjective** (judge-driven) evaluation — a cornerstone of modern **agentic benchmarking pipelines** and a precursor to continuous, self-reflective evaluation loops.\n"

    "### 🛡️ **Adversarial Testing and Safeguarding in Agentic Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLM-based agents don’t just need to be *smart* — they need to be **safe**.\n",
    "In real-world deployments, agents often face **adversarial inputs** — users (or other agents) that try to break the system, extract hidden instructions, or provoke harmful outputs.\n",
    "This section introduces **adversarial testing** and **guard models** — key pillars of *trustworthy AI evaluation and deployment*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚔️ What is Adversarial Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adversarial testing** (or *red-teaming*) is the deliberate process of probing AI systems with **malicious, confusing, or policy-violating inputs** to check:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How robustly the model resists **prompt injections** (“ignore previous instructions”, “reveal your system prompt”).\n",
    "* Whether it outputs **unsafe content** (insults, hate speech, unsafe instructions).\n",
    "* How often it produces **false positives** (overblocking) or **false negatives** (letting attacks slip through).\n",
    "\n",
    "In production-grade AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI API deployments), adversarial testing is an ongoing cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate synthetic or human-written attacks.\n",
    "2. Measure **guard accuracy, recall, and false positive rate**.\n",
    "3. Update safety filters and prompts continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that your agent doesn’t just perform well — it performs **responsibly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧰 What Are Guard Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guard models** are LLMs (or classifiers) fine-tuned specifically to **detect and block unsafe inputs or outputs** before they reach (or leave) the main model.\n",
    "They act like an intelligent firewall for LLM pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🧱 **Llama Guard (Meta, 2024)** — fine-tuned for content moderation and policy enforcement.\n",
    "* 🧩 **GPT-OSS-Safeguard (OpenRouter)** — open-source guard model for harmful content and prompt-injection detection.\n",
    "* 🧠 **Custom regex or lightweight classifiers** — useful as a fallback when safety models aren’t available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guards evaluate each message according to a **policy**, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “No harsh language, no prompt-injection attempts, no attempts to bypass safeguards.”\n",
    "\n",
    "If the input violates the policy, it’s **blocked** before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 How Safeguarding Works in Production\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world pipelines (like OpenAI’s or enterprise AI deployments):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every user input passes through a **safety layer** before being processed by the task agent.\n",
    "2. The safety layer decides:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * ✅ **Allow** — safe input → proceed to main model.\n",
    "   * 🚫 **Block** — unsafe → reject or route to moderation logs.\n",
    "3. Each block is **logged and explained** (for auditability and human review).\n",
    "4. Continuous monitoring and retraining ensure guards adapt to **new adversarial tactics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Safeguarding is critical because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It **prevents misuse** (e.g., generating harmful or policy-violating content).\n",
    "* It ensures **brand and legal compliance** (e.g., GDPR, safety policies).\n",
    "* It builds **trust** for AI systems interacting with users in open domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implements a **miniature version of a production safeguard pipeline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Policy Definition:**\n",
    "   A concise safety policy prohibits harsh language and prompt injections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Guard Agent (Llama Guard / GPT-OSS-Safeguard):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A dedicated **pydantic-ai agent** (`GUARD`) enforces the policy.\n",
    "   * Returns a structured decision (`allow`, `category`, `rationale`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Guarded Execution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The user message first goes through the guard.\n",
    "   * If blocked → return `\"Blocked per policy.\"`\n",
    "   * If safe → forward the request to the **main Pokémon task agent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adversarial Test Set:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Benign prompts:** normal task requests.\n",
    "   * **Adversarial prompts:** attempts to provoke or bypass safeguards (harsh language, prompt injection).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **True Positives (TP):** Attacks correctly blocked.\n",
    "   * **False Negatives (FN):** Attacks allowed (leakage).\n",
    "   * **False Positives (FP):** Benign queries wrongly blocked.\n",
    "   * **Precision, Recall, F1**, and **Leakage Rate** are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **End-to-End Guarded Flow:**\n",
    "   The `guarded_move_selection()` function simulates a **real production pipeline** — combining safety filtering and task reasoning in sequence.\n",
    "   It then reports:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Blocked vs. Allowed queries\n",
    "   * Leakage rate on attacks\n",
    "   * Allow rate on benign prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This code gives a **simplified yet realistic blueprint** of how **safety governance** is implemented in production LLM systems — showing that *responsibility* and *robustness* go hand-in-hand with *intelligence* in modern **agentic AI evaluation**.\n"
