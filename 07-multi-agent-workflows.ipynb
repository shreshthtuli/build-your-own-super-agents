    "# 🧠 Multi-Agent Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, **no single agent can solve every problem optimally**. As tasks grow in **uncertainty, dimensionality, and interdependence** — such as strategy games, simulations, robotics, or real-time business systems — we naturally evolve from *single-agent* reasoning to **multi-agent workflows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These workflows mirror how humans collaborate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🗳️ **Democratic committees** balance diverse perspectives.\n",
    "* 🧭 **Hierarchical managers** coordinate specialists under limited resources.\n",
    "* ⚖️ **Actor-Critic systems** separate exploration (actor) from judgment (critic).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pattern encodes a different *philosophy of coordination* — distributing intelligence across specialized roles that communicate, negotiate, and arbitrate toward a shared goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ What Are Multi-Agent Workflows?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **multi-agent workflow** is a structured network of reasoning and action nodes — planners, evaluators, arbiters, memory modules — that interact through explicit channels rather than a single monolithic prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a **graph of decision-making** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nodes = agents (LLMs, heuristics, or functions).\n",
    "* Edges = communication or dependency between them.\n",
    "* Memory = shared context that persists across steps.\n",
    "* Arbitration = how conflicting opinions are resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parallel specialization** (multiple evaluators in parallel).\n",
    "* **Conditional routing** (managers deciding who to consult).\n",
    "* **Resource budgeting** (decide when to skip expensive reasoning).\n",
    "* **Explainability & debugging** (explicit traces of who decided what).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Enter [Pydantic Graphs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/graph/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Building and managing these interactions manually is painful — tracking state, type safety, branching, and parallel execution can get messy fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pydantic Graphs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/graph/) solves this elegantly by combining:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ **Typed data flow** from Pydantic models — ensuring every node’s input and output are structured, validated, and traceable.\n",
    "* 🕸️ **Graph orchestration** — defining agents and their dependencies as composable, inspectable workflows.\n",
    "* 🔁 **Parallel & conditional execution** — automatically handling fan-out (multiple evaluators) and routing logic (manager/critic decisions).\n",
    "* 🧾 **Transparent traces** — every step’s inputs, outputs, and reasoning can be logged, visualized, and replayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, they turn the messy spaghetti of agent calls into a **declarative decision graph** — a scalable foundation for complex, memory-aware, multi-agent systems."

    "### 🧩 What is `poke-env`?\n",
    "\n",
    "[`poke-env`](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a **Python interface to the Pokémon Showdown battle simulator**, providing an environment for reinforcement learning and AI experiments.\n",
    "It exposes each battle as a structured API — giving access to game state (Pokémon, moves, types, HP, etc.) and allowing agents to pick legal actions programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our workflow, we’ll use **`poke-env` as the testbed** to:\n",

    "* 📊 **Compare performance** through metrics like win rate, turns survived, and move efficiency.\n",
    "* 🧠 **Benchmark reasoning styles** — seeing how coordination strategies translate into competitive outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running experiments, we’ll start a local Pokémon Showdown server instance. This spins up a self-contained battle environment where our agents can safely train, plan, and battle — making Pokémon the perfect arena for testing *agentic intelligence in action*."

    "**Core mechanics (what the agent must reason about):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Turn-based actions:** Each turn you either **use a move** or **switch**. Faster Pokémon usually act first; **priority** can override speed.\n",
    "* **Types & STAB:** Moves have types (e.g., *Electric*). Effectiveness depends on attacker vs defender types; using a move matching the user’s type grants **STAB** (bonus damage).\n",
    "* **Accuracy & PP:** Moves can **miss** (accuracy < 100) and have limited **PP** (uses).\n",
    "* **HP & fainting:** A Pokémon faints at 0 HP; win condition is **faint all opponent Pokémon**.\n",
    "* **Information limits:** You only know the opponent’s **revealed** Pokémon and partial info about their sets.\n",
    "* **Switching & tempo:** Switching preserves a weakened Pokémon, but concedes tempo (opponent gets a “free” hit).\n",
    "* **Status/hazards/weather (omitted here for brevity):** These exist in the simulator; we can add them later as fields.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* `TeamMon`: one entry per Pokémon (both sides) with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `species`, fractional `hp`, `fainted`, and `types`.\n",
    "* `MoveOption`: one entry per **legal move this turn** with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `move_id`, `base_power`, `accuracy`, `move_type`, `pp`, `priority`.\n",
    "* `SwitchOption`: one entry per **legal switch target** with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `species`, `hp`, `fainted`, `types`.\n",
    "* `AgentContext`: the full **decision frame** the agent sees:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `turn`: current turn number.\n",
    "  * `you_active` / `opp_active`: currently active Pokémon on both sides.\n",
    "  * `you_team`: your full team (known).\n",
    "  * `opp_known`: only **revealed** opponent Pokémon (respecting partial observability).\n",
    "  * `legal_moves` / `legal_switches`: the **only actions you may take now**.\n",
    "  * `past_actions`: a short **episodic memory** string list (e.g., summaries of last turns).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ How the code builds this context\n",
    "\n",
    "* `_pokemon_to_teammon(p)` safely converts a poke-env `Pokemon` into our `TeamMon` schema (species, hp%, types).\n",
    "* In `build_context(battle, past_actions)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We iterate `battle.available_moves` to populate `MoveOption` (capturing **damage proxies** via base power, **reliability** via accuracy, **tempo** via priority, and **resource** via PP).\n",
    "  * We iterate `battle.available_switches` to populate `SwitchOption` (capturing **survivability** options).\n",
    "  * We map your full `battle.team` into `you_team` and the opponent’s **revealed** team into `opp_known` (partial info).\n",
    "  * We capture actives (`you_active`, `opp_active`) and the `turn` counter.\n",
    "  * We attach `past_actions` so the LLM can reason with **short-term memory**.\n",
    "* `agent_context_to_string(ctx)` serializes the `AgentContext` to **pretty JSON**, ideal for prompting an LLM agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** every decision step provides a **compact, validated, and complete** view of what matters **now**, aligning game mechanics with agent reasoning (damage, risk, tempo, information, and legal constraints).\n"

    "### 🕸️ Introducing *Pydantic Graphs* — the foundation for structured multi-agent workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our agent acted as a **single decision-maker**: it observed context, reasoned once, and returned a move. But as environments grow in complexity — multiple objectives, conflicting strategies, limited time — we need **many specialized agents** working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where **🧩 Pydantic Graphs** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ What are *Pydantic Graphs*?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pydantic Graphs** extend the idea of *typed LLM workflows*: instead of chaining prompts manually, you define a **graph of agents** — each node is a typed, callable component (`Agent`, `Tool`, or function), and edges represent how their structured outputs flow into each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node’s input/output types are enforced by **Pydantic models**, guaranteeing that\n",
    "✅ every agent receives valid structured data,\n",
    "✅ workflows are composable, debuggable, and inspectable,\n",
    "✅ and parallel/conditional execution (“run these 3 evaluators in parallel”) becomes trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤝 Why multi-agent workflows?\n",
    "\n",
    "Real decision problems rarely have one “best” heuristic — they’re **multi-objective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tactical reward vs safety (damage vs survivability)\n",
    "* Short-term payoff vs long-term setup\n",
    "* Exploration vs exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent graphs let you **distribute cognition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each node/agent handles a sub-skill (planner, tactician, risk, scout).\n",
    "* Coordination logic (e.g., a manager or arbiter) **fuses** their reasoning.\n",
    "* Memory and arbitration layers can be swapped independently (for ablations).\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture naturally scales to **agentic swarms** — large ensembles of specialized agents that coordinate dynamically, forming emergent intelligence beyond a single model’s scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔀 Static vs Dynamic Query Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier “Manager” agent, the routing (which specialists to call) was **static** — we hard-coded: “always call Tactician, call Risk if danger > 0.6, call Scout every 3 turns”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic routing**, enabled by Pydantic Graphs, makes this adaptive:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each agent’s outputs (or intermediate metadata like *uncertainty*, *cost*, or *confidence*) can dynamically decide the next edges to traverse.\n",
    "* If the planner returns low-confidence moves, the graph might automatically trigger the *Risk Officer* or *Critic* path.\n",
    "* If confidence is high, it can skip extra steps to save latency or tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧩 **Benefit:** Resource-aware, self-adapting workflows that scale gracefully — the system “thinks harder” only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✏️ Query Rewriting\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advanced feature is **query rewriting** — when incoming queries or contexts are **transformed before being passed** to downstream agents. In Pokémon terms, before the planner decides, a *context rewriter* might:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplify redundant details (“ignore irrelevant side conditions”), or\n",
    "* Add derived features (“this move is likely super-effective against Water”).\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets different specialists receive **domain-specific representations** of the same state, improving efficiency and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Why it matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, **dynamic routing** and **query rewriting** turn a static, hand-crafted pipeline into a **living cognitive graph**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 💡 *Adaptive*: reasoning depth scales with uncertainty or stakes.\n",
    "* 🧠 *Modular*: new skills or evaluators can be plugged in as new nodes.\n",
    "* ⚖️ *Efficient*: token and time budgets are managed intelligently.\n",
    "* 🔍 *Transparent*: every decision path and intermediate output is traceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using *Pydantic Graphs*, we can finally move from “prompt chains” to **structured, interpretable agentic systems** — the same architectural leap that turns simple agents into full-fledged, cooperative AI swarms."
