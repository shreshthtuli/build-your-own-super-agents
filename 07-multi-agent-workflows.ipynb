    "# 07. Multi-Agent Workflows and Agentic Swarms\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, **no single agent can solve every problem optimally**. As tasks grow in **uncertainty, dimensionality, and interdependence** — such as strategy games, simulations, robotics, or real-time business systems — we naturally evolve from *single-agent* reasoning to **multi-agent workflows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These workflows mirror how humans collaborate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🗳️ **Democratic committees** balance diverse perspectives.\n",
    "* 🧭 **Hierarchical managers** coordinate specialists under limited resources.\n",
    "* ⚖️ **Actor-Critic systems** separate exploration (actor) from judgment (critic).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pattern encodes a different *philosophy of coordination* — distributing intelligence across specialized roles that communicate, negotiate, and arbitrate toward a shared goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ What Are Multi-Agent Workflows?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **multi-agent workflow** is a structured network of reasoning and action nodes — planners, evaluators, arbiters, memory modules — that interact through explicit channels rather than a single monolithic prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a **graph of decision-making** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nodes = agents (LLMs, heuristics, or functions).\n",
    "* Edges = communication or dependency between them.\n",
    "* Memory = shared context that persists across steps.\n",
    "* Arbitration = how conflicting opinions are resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parallel specialization** (multiple evaluators in parallel).\n",
    "* **Conditional routing** (managers deciding who to consult).\n",
    "* **Resource budgeting** (decide when to skip expensive reasoning).\n",
    "* **Explainability & debugging** (explicit traces of who decided what).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Enter [Pydantic Graphs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/graph/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Building and managing these interactions manually is painful — tracking state, type safety, branching, and parallel execution can get messy fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pydantic Graphs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/graph/) solves this elegantly by combining:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ **Typed data flow** from Pydantic models — ensuring every node’s input and output are structured, validated, and traceable.\n",
    "* 🕸️ **Graph orchestration** — defining agents and their dependencies as composable, inspectable workflows.\n",
    "* 🔁 **Parallel & conditional execution** — automatically handling fan-out (multiple evaluators) and routing logic (manager/critic decisions).\n",
    "* 🧾 **Transparent traces** — every step’s inputs, outputs, and reasoning can be logged, visualized, and replayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, they turn the messy spaghetti of agent calls into a **declarative decision graph** — a scalable foundation for complex, memory-aware, multi-agent systems."

    "### 🧩 What is `poke-env`?\n",
    "\n",
    "[`poke-env`](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a **Python interface to the Pokémon Showdown battle simulator**, providing an environment for reinforcement learning and AI experiments.\n",
    "It exposes each battle as a structured API — giving access to game state (Pokémon, moves, types, HP, etc.) and allowing agents to pick legal actions programmatically.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before running experiments, we’ll start a local Pokémon Showdown server instance. This spins up a self-contained battle environment where our agents can safely train, plan, and battle — making Pokémon the perfect arena for testing *agentic intelligence in action*."

    "Let's now build a simple agent to do the same, as in, use the battle context to choose the optimal action. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Core mechanics (what the agent must reason about):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Turn-based actions:** Each turn you either **use a move** or **switch**. Faster Pokémon usually act first; **priority** can override speed.\n",
    "* **Types & STAB:** Moves have types (e.g., *Electric*). Effectiveness depends on attacker vs defender types; using a move matching the user’s type grants **STAB** (bonus damage).\n",
    "* **Accuracy & PP:** Moves can **miss** (accuracy < 100) and have limited **PP** (uses).\n",
    "* **HP & fainting:** A Pokémon faints at 0 HP; win condition is **faint all opponent Pokémon**.\n",
    "* **Information limits:** You only know the opponent’s **revealed** Pokémon and partial info about their sets.\n",
    "* **Switching & tempo:** Switching preserves a weakened Pokémon, but concedes tempo (opponent gets a “free” hit).\n",
    "* **Status/hazards/weather (omitted here for brevity):** These exist in the simulator; we can add them later as fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧱 Our context schema (how we feed the LLM the game state)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* `TeamMon`: one entry per Pokémon (both sides) with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `species`, fractional `hp`, `fainted`, and `types`.\n",
    "* `MoveOption`: one entry per **legal move this turn** with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `move_id`, `base_power`, `accuracy`, `move_type`, `pp`, `priority`.\n",
    "* `SwitchOption`: one entry per **legal switch target** with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `species`, `hp`, `fainted`, `types`.\n",
    "* `AgentContext`: the full **decision frame** the agent sees:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `turn`: current turn number.\n",
    "  * `you_active` / `opp_active`: currently active Pokémon on both sides.\n",
    "  * `you_team`: your full team (known).\n",
    "  * `opp_known`: only **revealed** opponent Pokémon (respecting partial observability).\n",
    "  * `legal_moves` / `legal_switches`: the **only actions you may take now**.\n",
    "  * `past_actions`: a short **episodic memory** string list (e.g., summaries of last turns).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🛠️ How the code builds this context\n",
    "\n",
    "* `_pokemon_to_teammon(p)` safely converts a poke-env `Pokemon` into our `TeamMon` schema (species, hp%, types).\n",
    "* In `build_context(battle, past_actions)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We iterate `battle.available_moves` to populate `MoveOption` (capturing **damage proxies** via base power, **reliability** via accuracy, **tempo** via priority, and **resource** via PP).\n",
    "  * We iterate `battle.available_switches` to populate `SwitchOption` (capturing **survivability** options).\n",
    "  * We map your full `battle.team` into `you_team` and the opponent’s **revealed** team into `opp_known` (partial info).\n",
    "  * We capture actives (`you_active`, `opp_active`) and the `turn` counter.\n",
    "  * We attach `past_actions` so the LLM can reason with **short-term memory**.\n",
    "* `agent_context_to_string(ctx)` serializes the `AgentContext` to **pretty JSON**, ideal for prompting an LLM agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** every decision step provides a **compact, validated, and complete** view of what matters **now**, aligning game mechanics with agent reasoning (damage, risk, tempo, information, and legal constraints).\n"

    "## 🕸️ Introducing *Pydantic Graphs* — the foundation for structured multi-agent workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our agent acted as a **single decision-maker**: it observed context, reasoned once, and returned a move. But as environments grow in complexity — multiple objectives, conflicting strategies, limited time — we need **many specialized agents** working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where **🧩 Pydantic Graphs** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ What are *Pydantic Graphs*?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pydantic Graphs** extend the idea of *typed LLM workflows*: instead of chaining prompts manually, you define a **graph of agents** — each node is a typed, callable component (`Agent`, `Tool`, or function), and edges represent how their structured outputs flow into each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node’s input/output types are enforced by **Pydantic models**, guaranteeing that\n",
    "✅ every agent receives valid structured data,\n",
    "✅ workflows are composable, debuggable, and inspectable,\n",
    "✅ and parallel/conditional execution (“run these 3 evaluators in parallel”) becomes trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤝 Why multi-agent workflows?\n",
    "\n",
    "Real decision problems rarely have one “best” heuristic — they’re **multi-objective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tactical reward vs safety (damage vs survivability)\n",
    "* Short-term payoff vs long-term setup\n",
    "* Exploration vs exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent graphs let you **distribute cognition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each node/agent handles a sub-skill (planner, tactician, risk, scout).\n",
    "* Coordination logic (e.g., a manager or arbiter) **fuses** their reasoning.\n",
    "* Memory and arbitration layers can be swapped independently (for ablations).\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture naturally scales to **agentic swarms** — large ensembles of specialized agents that coordinate dynamically, forming emergent intelligence beyond a single model’s scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔀 Static vs Dynamic Query Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier “Manager” agent, the routing (which specialists to call) was **static** — we hard-coded: “always call Tactician, call Risk if danger > 0.6, call Scout every 3 turns”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic routing**, enabled by Pydantic Graphs, makes this adaptive:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each agent’s outputs (or intermediate metadata like *uncertainty*, *cost*, or *confidence*) can dynamically decide the next edges to traverse.\n",
    "* If the planner returns low-confidence moves, the graph might automatically trigger the *Risk Officer* or *Critic* path.\n",
    "* If confidence is high, it can skip extra steps to save latency or tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧩 **Benefit:** Resource-aware, self-adapting workflows that scale gracefully — the system “thinks harder” only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✏️ Query Rewriting\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advanced feature is **query rewriting** — when incoming queries or contexts are **transformed before being passed** to downstream agents. In Pokémon terms, before the planner decides, a *context rewriter* might:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplify redundant details (“ignore irrelevant side conditions”), or\n",
    "* Add derived features (“this move is likely super-effective against Water”).\n",
    "\n",
    "This lets different specialists receive **domain-specific representations** of the same state, improving efficiency and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚀 Why it matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, **dynamic routing** and **query rewriting** turn a static, hand-crafted pipeline into a **living cognitive graph**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 💡 *Adaptive*: reasoning depth scales with uncertainty or stakes.\n",
    "* 🧠 *Modular*: new skills or evaluators can be plugged in as new nodes.\n",
    "* ⚖️ *Efficient*: token and time budgets are managed intelligently.\n",
    "* 🔍 *Transparent*: every decision path and intermediate output is traceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using *Pydantic Graphs*, we can finally move from “prompt chains” to **structured, interpretable agentic systems** — the same architectural leap that turns simple agents into full-fledged, cooperative AI swarms."

    "## 🧭 The Manager–Coordinator Paradigm in Agentic Swarms\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now implement our first multi-agent workflow: **managerial multi-agent coordination pattern** through a structured **Pydantic Graph** — where each node acts as a specialized agent, and together they form a **coordinated decision-making swarm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🕸️ The Idea: Manager + Specialists = Smarter Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying on a single monolithic model, this setup distributes reasoning across multiple specialized roles — just like a management hierarchy in human organizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PlannerNode (Coordinator)** 🧠 → proposes candidate actions (moves/switches).\n",
    "* **TacticianNode** ⚔️ → evaluates each candidate for *expected value* (damage, tempo).\n",
    "* **RiskNode** 🛡️ → evaluates *safety and survivability*.\n",
    "* **ScoutNode** 🔍 → evaluates *information gain* (learning about opponent’s hidden Pokémon).\n",
    "* **DecisionNode (Manager)** 🧩 → aggregates all scores and makes the final move selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node operates independently but shares a common state (`GraphState`) that persists through the workflow — this gives the system **continuity**, **explainability**, and **structured memory** across reasoning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ How Pydantic Graphs Enable This\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic Graphs make this **explicitly declarative**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each node inherits from `BaseNode` and defines an **`async run()`** method that updates a shared `GraphState`.\n",
    "* Nodes specify their **next node** — e.g., `PlannerNode → TacticianNode → RiskNode → ScoutNode → DecisionNode → End`.\n",
    "* The `Graph` object (`planner_graph`) defines the entire workflow and its **state type** (`GraphState`), ensuring all data between nodes remains valid and typed.\n",
    "* The graph runtime (`GraphRunContext`) automatically handles **execution order**, **state persistence**, and **error handling/retries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the graph acts as an **orchestration layer** over multiple LLMs — a mini “swarm intelligence” system where reasoning flows like information through an organization chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Why the Manager-Coordinator Model Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decomposition of reasoning:**\n",
    "   Each agent focuses on a narrow cognitive skill — simplifying prompts, improving interpretability, and reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallelism and composability:**\n",
    "   Multiple evaluators can be executed concurrently, and new agents (e.g., “Healer Advisor”, “Weather Analyst”) can be plugged in without refactoring the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explainability:**\n",
    "   Every step is transparent — you can inspect the planner’s candidates, each specialist’s scores, and the rationale behind the final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic scalability:**\n",
    "   The manager can later evolve to **dynamic routing**, consulting only relevant specialists based on battle context or uncertainty — enabling true **adaptive swarms**.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * `AccuracyVoterNode` – prefer high-reliability actions (≥90% accuracy or safe switch).\n",
    "  * `TypeMatchupVoterNode` – reward good type effectiveness or improved matchup after switch.\n",
    "  * `TempoVoterNode` – prefer momentum (threaten KO, force a switch, safe setup).\n",
    "  * `PPVoterNode` – favor conserving scarce PP/resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use **Democratic** when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You want **robustness via diversity**: many simple judges smooth out any one agent’s bias.\n",
    "* The task benefits from **ensemble wisdom** and **parallel scoring** of options.\n",
    "* You need **transparent preference profiles** (“why did we pick this?” → look at voter tallies).\n",
    "* Latency budget allows **fan-out** to several voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Manager–Coordinator** when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need **budget-aware routing** (call specialists only when danger/uncertainty is high).\n",
    "* The task has a **clear decision funnel** (plan → specific specialists → decision).\n",
    "* You want **conditional depth** (think harder only when needed) for tighter SLAs.\n",
    "* You prefer a single **final authority** aggregating nuanced scores/metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exploration, variety, early prototyping** → start with **Democracy**.\n",
    "* **Production with SLAs, cost constraints** → move to **Manager/Coordinator** (dynamic routing, early exit).\n",

    "### 🧬 Mixed-model ensembles (per-agent LLMs)\n",

    "\n",

    "### 🎭 Actor–Critic Multi-Agent Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final agentic swarm model is the **actor–critic** style workflow, again implemented using `pydantic-graph`. This model is inspired by reinforcement learning but adapted for multi-LLM reasoning. Here, we explicitly separate **proposal** and **evaluation**, allowing the agent swarm to reason iteratively about *value* and *risk* before acting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Roles and flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph proceeds through four main nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`ActorNode` – The policy generator**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Proposes 3–4 **legal moves or switches** based on the current Pokémon context.\n",
    "   * Behaves like a policy network, outputting candidate actions with rationales.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`CriticNode` – The value estimator**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Evaluates each candidate with a **Q-value** (expected outcome), **risk**, and **confidence** score.\n",
    "   * This acts as a “value network” estimating how good each candidate really is.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`ImproveNode` – The policy improver (optional)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If the best candidate is too risky or has low Q-value, the improver agent asks the actor to **refine** its plan.\n",
    "   * The critic is then re-invoked to rescore the improved candidates.\n",
    "   * This mimics the *actor–critic policy improvement loop* in RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`SelectorNode` – The final decision layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Combines critic outputs into an adjusted score:\n",
    "     $\\text{AdjustedScore} = Q \\times (1 - \\lambda \\cdot \\text{risk}) \\times (0.5 + 0.5 \\times \\text{confidence})$\n",
    "   * Picks the candidate with the highest adjusted value and terminates the graph with an `End` node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What makes this pattern powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterative refinement** – Unlike the manager-coordinator (hierarchical) or democratic (ensemble) designs, the actor–critic loop *learns from its own evaluation*.\n",
    "* **Value-based reasoning** – The critic explicitly quantifies the *expected reward* of each move, enabling long-term strategic play rather than greedy local choices.\n",
    "* **Adaptive depth** – The `ImproveNode` only triggers refinement when quality or safety drops, giving us dynamic compute allocation.\n",
    "* **Interpretability** – Q-values, risk, and confidence are visible for each decision, so you can trace *why* the agent preferred one move over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Comparing paradigms\n",
    "\n",

    "### 🚀 Why it fits Pokémon and beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "* Battles require balancing **expected gain vs. survivability**, just like value-based RL tasks.\n",
    "* The critic captures **contextual trade-offs** (damage, tempo, risk), while the actor continuously learns what kinds of proposals score best.\n",
    "* This same structure can generalize to *decision-making agents* in finance, robotics, or multi-stage planning — anywhere feedback-driven refinement is useful.\n"

    "### 🏁 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explored how **multi-agent workflows** enable structured, interpretable reasoning in complex environments — using Pokémon battles as our sandbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "We built and compared three distinct coordination paradigms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🧠 **Manager–Coordinator:** hierarchical and resource-aware — perfect for structured, goal-driven orchestration.\n",
    "* 🗳️ **Democratic Swarms:** ensemble-style decision-making — robust and diverse, harnessing the collective judgment of many agents.\n",
    "* 🎭 **Actor–Critic:** feedback-driven refinement — adaptive and value-based, blending planning with learned evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each architecture has strengths depending on your **problem structure**, **latency budget**, and **decision uncertainty**. Together, they form the foundation of *Agentic AI systems* — not just single agents, but entire **cognitive ecosystems** working in concert.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 Beyond these: other agentic swarm paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern agent research spans several other fascinating coordination styles that extend or hybridize these ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🕸️ **Blackboard Systems / Shared Memory Agents** — agents read and write to a common “knowledge blackboard” (e.g., **HUB**, **LangGraph Shared Memory**, **ReAct with tool state**).\n",
    "* 🪶 **Evolutionary or Genetic Agent Swarms** — agents mutate and compete (e.g., **EvoAgents**, [Yuan et al. (2024)](https://evo-agent.github.io/)) to explore strategy space efficiently.\n",
    "* 🔁 **Agentic Swarms** — multiple agents monitor and fine-tune their own reasoning, using reflection or secondary evaluators (e.g., **SwarmAgentic**, [Zhang et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15672)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these paradigms form a growing ecosystem of **Agentic Swarms** — distributed reasoning systems where intelligence emerges from structured interaction rather than single-model dominance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔮 What’s next\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve focused on *how agents reason and collaborate*.\n",
    "In the **next tutorial**, we’ll explore *how to select the optimal model for each agent automatically* —\n",
    "using **meta-evaluation**, **model profiling**, and **cost–quality trade-offs** to dynamically assign the best LLM to each sub-task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll essentially teach our system to **self-optimize its model choices** — the first step toward *autonomous orchestration* in large multi-agent setups.\n"
