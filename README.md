Welcome to **Build Your Own Super Agents** — a fast, fun, no-fluff adventure into agentic AI. In these notebooks, you’ll train agents, evolve them, and even make them battle (yes, there are [Pokémon](https://shreshthtuli.github.io/build-your-own-super-agents/07-multi-agent-workflows.html#creating-a-max-damage-baseline:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20see%20an%20example%20battle%20in%20action.)). You’ll start with a tiny single-step agent and end up commanding full swarms that can plan, retrieve, reason, and act. Whether you’re a researcher, engineer, or curious tinkerer, this course gives you everything you need to level up from simple prompts to real super-agent systems. 🚀🌟

## 🎯 Course Highlights
* **Fully hands-on agentic notebooks** for every module — clone locally or run instantly in your preferred Jupyter environment.
* **Practical agent templates, evaluators, and tool integrations** so you can build real agents without drowning in boilerplate orchestration code.
* **Clear theory, references, and best-practice design patterns** interwoven with examples to make every agentic concept intuitive and reproducible.
* **Production-ready mindset throughout** — covering retrieval, graph reasoning, multi-agent coordination, reflection loops, model routing/selection, cost-latency tradeoffs, and cloud-scale deployment.


## 📚 Course Structure

Each module is a self-contained notebook filled with explanations, demos, and practical agentic workflows. You can browse them on GitHub Pages, clone them locally, or run them interactively in your preferred notebook environment.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

* How to design an agent’s full loop — perception, retrieval, reasoning, planning, and action.
* How to use modern agentic frameworks to add tools, memory, structured outputs, and multi-step workflows.
* Techniques for building powerful retrieval systems (RAG), knowledge graphs, and GraphRAG pipelines.
* How to evaluate agents with confidence metrics, behavioural tests, and multi-agent benchmarking.
* How to build, coordinate, and optimize multi-agent swarms that collaborate or compete.

## 🧭 Suggested Learning Path

1. **Foundations (Modules 01–03)** – Build your first agent, understand agentic loops, and layer in prompting + reflection.
2. **Retrieval & Knowledge (Modules 04–05)** – Add RAG, build knowledge graphs, and integrate GraphRAG into agent workflows.
3. **Evaluation & Behaviour (Module 06)** – Learn how to measure agent performance, confidence, robustness, and reasoning quality.
4. **Multi-Agent Systems (Module 07)** – Coordinate multiple agents, share context, resolve conflicts, and design agent swarms.
5. **Orchestration (Modules 08–09)** – Master model selection, routing, placement, and the cost–latency–quality trade-offs that power real systems.
6. **Capstone** – Combine everything to build, evaluate, and deploy a production-ready super-agent tailored to your real use case.

Every notebook stands alone, but following this sequence gives you the smoothest progression from simple agents to fully orchestrated super-agents.
