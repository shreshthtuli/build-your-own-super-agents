    "### 🧠 09. Orchestration 2: Model Placement\n",
    "\n",
    "As **super-agentic systems** scale, they often operate across a hierarchy of compute environments — from **on-device edge models** to **powerful cloud-scale LLMs**. Each layer offers a different trade-off between **latency**, **cost**, and **response quality**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ⚡ **Edge / On-Device SLMs** → low latency, low cost, privacy-preserving, but limited model capacity.\n",
    "* ☁️ **Cloud LLMs** → high reasoning depth and accuracy, but higher latency and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an **agentic orchestration pipeline**, deciding *where* to run a given sub-task or prompt is just as critical as *which model* to run. This is known as **Model Placement** — the process of intelligently routing a request to the most appropriate compute layer based on context, workload, and desired trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Why Model Placement Matters in Super Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern **super agents**—multi-agent systems coordinating perception, reasoning, and action—require near-real-time responses while maintaining reliability and depth. In such systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Challenge | Edge-Only | Cloud-Only  | Intelligent Placement |\n",
    "| --------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------------- |\n",
    "| Latency   | ✅ Fast    | ❌ Slow      | ⚖️ Adaptive           |\n",
    "| Accuracy  | ❌ Limited | ✅ High      | ⚖️ Task-aware         |\n",
    "| Cost      | ✅ Cheap   | ❌ Expensive | ⚖️ Budget-controlled  |\n",
    "| Privacy   | ✅ Local   | ❌ Shared    | ⚖️ Policy-driven      |\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-designed placement policy helps super agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ⚖️ **Balance response quality and latency** dynamically.\n",
    "* 💸 **Optimize cost and energy efficiency** across distributed compute.\n",
    "* 🔐 **Respect data locality and privacy constraints** when required.\n",
    "* 🤝 **Coordinate multiple sub-agents** that may depend on each other’s outputs in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 From Static to Adaptive Placement\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, developers hard-coded these choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Run summaries locally.”\n",
    "* “Use GPT-4 for reasoning.”\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this **static placement** breaks down at scale—when user load fluctuates, or when prompt complexity varies. In this tutorial, we take a **data-driven**, **agentic** approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect latency and quality data from multiple placement options (Edge vs Cloud).\n",
    "2. Learn an **offline multi-armed bandit policy** that chooses the optimal placement per prompt.\n",
    "3. Integrate it directly into a **Pydantic-AI agent**, so it automatically routes future requests to the best environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are building a smart-glass application, we want to be able to predict which layer, edge or cloud, would give a higher quality of service (QoS) for a given prompt. Assuming we start with a random selection policy, we can obtain *human-perceived* QoS from annotators for this baseline policy. Then, we can use simple embeddings models such as [EmbeddingGemma](https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/embeddinggemma/) that provide a dense vector representation for a given prompt and train a predictor for input prompt to predicted QoS. This paradigm is called a \"multi-armed bandit\" setting. More details [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/intro_bandit). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have this, we can select the appropriate arm at test time. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image](assets/model_placement.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this fictitious example, we see that the predicted QoS of `edge` is higher and hence can be used for the given time-critical task as it has lower latency. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world deployments—like personalized assistants, multi-modal copilots, or large-scale customer service agents—**model placement is a production-critical decision**.\n",
    "It directly determines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🕒 **User experience latency**\n",
    "* 🧠 **Perceived intelligence**\n",
    "* 💰 **Operational cost and carbon footprint**\n",
    "\n",
    "By teaching agents to *learn placement policies* from data, we move from rigid orchestration to **self-optimizing agentic systems** — a key capability of truly intelligent, scalable AI infrastructure."

    "\n",
    "To make model placement **data-driven**, our bandit needs to understand *what kind of prompt* it’s dealing with. A short, urgent prompt like *“I smell smoke, what should I do?”* should prefer low-latency **edge models**,\n",
    "whereas a long, complex instruction like *“Summarize this legal document paragraph by paragraph”* should favor the **cloud**.\n",

    "Here, we use **OpenRouter’s `text-embedding-3-large`** model to embed each prompt in both our training and test datasets. This step gives our upcoming **multi-armed bandit regressor** the ability to reason not just about which arm (Edge vs Cloud) performed better in the past, but *why* — enabling intelligent placement for new prompts that the system hasn’t encountered before."

    "The catch? You don’t know which machine will pay off better until you’ve tried it multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the essence of the **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)** problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> How can we learn to choose between multiple options (arms) that yield uncertain rewards,\n",
    "> balancing **exploration** (trying new options) and **exploitation** (sticking with the best one)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each **arm** corresponds to a model placement — either **Edge** or **Cloud**.\n",
    "* Each **prompt** (user query) is a distinct “pull,” with different outcomes based on complexity and sensitivity to latency.\n",
    "* The **reward** is the **Quality of Service (QoS)** — a combined measure of speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually writing rules like *“short prompts go to edge”*, we let a model **learn the reward function** directly from real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 How XGBoost Learns the Placement Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we treated each arm separately and trained a model per arm.\n",
    "Now, we take a more **holistic approach** — our model learns to predict **both Edge and Cloud QoS values simultaneously** from the same input embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each training example consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** prompt embedding (semantic representation of the query).\n",
    "* **Output:** a *pair* of QoS values — $[QoS_edge, QoS_cloud]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This turns the problem into a **multi-output regression task**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(\\text{prompt\\_embedding}) \\rightarrow [\\widehat{QoS}_{edge}, \\widehat{QoS}_{cloud}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At inference time, the model predicts both QoS scores for each new prompt and simply routes the query to the environment (Edge or Cloud) that yields the higher predicted reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Although XGBoost isn’t a bandit algorithm per se, using it in this **multi-output setup** allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn **joint correlations** between prompt semantics and both Edge/Cloud performance.\n",
    "* Avoid redundant arm-specific data expansion, reducing noise and computation.\n",
    "* Enable **fast, real-time routing** — one forward pass per prompt, two QoS predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we’ve evolved from simulating “two separate slot machines” into a **context-aware reward predictor** that learns both arms jointly.\n",
    "This makes placement decisions smoother, more adaptive, and easily extensible to future setups (e.g., multiple edge devices or specialized cloud tiers)."

    "### 🤖 Making Placement Decisions with the Learned Bandit\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our **multi-output XGBoost regressor** has learned to jointly predict the expected QoS for both **Edge** and **Cloud**,\n",
    "we can use it to make **context-aware, data-driven placement decisions** for unseen prompts in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how this process unfolds:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single-step prediction:**\n",
    "   For each test prompt, we feed its **semantic embedding** into the trained model.\n",
    "   The model simultaneously outputs two predicted QoS values:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `pred_edge_qos` → expected performance if run on the **Edge**,\n",
    "   * `pred_cloud_qos` → expected performance if run on the **Cloud**.\n",
    "     No need to construct per-arm feature vectors — both predictions emerge from a single forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adaptive selection:**\n",
    "   The policy then compares the two predicted values and selects the placement environment with the **higher expected QoS**:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{selected\\_arm} = \\arg\\max(\\widehat{QoS}_{edge}, \\widehat{QoS}_{cloud})\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   This yields an intelligent routing decision tailored to each prompt’s characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretation and analysis:**\n",
    "   By observing the distribution of selections (e.g., percentage routed to edge vs. cloud),\n",
    "   we can assess how well the model adapts to context — choosing low-latency environments for quick queries\n",
    "   and high-quality environments for reasoning-heavy ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step effectively **closes the loop**: our learned reward model becomes a **live routing policy**,\n",
    "capable of dynamically assigning model placements in real time to balance latency, quality, and overall system efficiency.\n",

    "### 🏁 Conclusion: Intelligent Model Placement for Super-Agentic Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment demonstrated how **model placement** — deciding *where* a model should run (Edge vs Cloud) — can be learned **automatically** using a data-driven approach.\n",
    "By simulating latency and quality trade-offs and training a **multi-armed bandit regressor**, we built a system that dynamically selects the most suitable execution environment per prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results above highlight clear takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ⚡ **Edge-only** policies deliver fast responses but suffer in quality.\n",
    "* ☁️ **Cloud-only** policies maximize accuracy but incur significant latency.\n",
    "* 🤖 **Our proposed bandit-based policy** learns to **balance both**, achieving the **highest overall QoS**, dynamically routing tasks based on context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌍 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world **super-agentic architectures**, agents continuously interact with both **local** and **remote** compute.\n",
    "Static rules (“short prompts → edge, long ones → cloud”) break down as workloads evolve.\n",
    "Instead, learned placement policies adapt to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real-time network conditions,\n",

    "### 🧠 Beyond Bandits — Advanced Research Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "While we used an offline **multi-armed bandit (MAB)** regressor, several advanced research methods push this idea further:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contextual Bandits with Neural Embeddings** —\n",
    "   Use transformer-based embeddings or state encoders to learn non-linear context–reward relationships (e.g., LinUCB [(Lin et al. 2012)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.0146), NeuralUCB [(Zhou et al. 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04462)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reinforcement Learning for Placement** —\n",
    "   Frame placement as a sequential decision problem (state = load, network, prompt type).\n",
    "   Techniques: **Deep Q-Networks** [(Mnih et al. 2013)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602), **PPO** [(Schulman et al. 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347), or **Actor–Critic** [(Han et al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14288) models for adaptive orchestration. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Agent Scheduling Systems** —\n",
    "   Each agent decides *locally* (Edge/Cloud/Hybrid) and coordinates through message passing, resembling **federated reinforcement learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Resource-Aware Routing** —\n",
    "   Combine placement with **cost and energy models**, using RL or **multi-objective optimization** to minimize latency, maximize accuracy, and respect power constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Graph-Based Placement** —\n",
    "   Model the computation graph of multi-step reasoning and assign each node to optimal compute using **graph optimization** or **neural architecture search (NAS)** [(Zoph et al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01578) style methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Adaptive and Continual Learning** —\n",
    "   Incorporate user feedback loops (RLHF-style) to continually improve placement decisions as environment and models evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, **model selection**, **intelligent routing**, and **dynamic placement** together form the cognitive backbone of super agents — systems that don’t just *use* intelligence, but *orchestrate* it across models, contexts, and environments to think, act, and adapt like living ecosystems of AI.\n"
