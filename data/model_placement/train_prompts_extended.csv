Therefore, latency is the primary factor in determining the QoS score. Quality is extremely important, but given the critical nature of the instruction, we want to prioritize which response will be delivered fastest. The QoS for edge is calculated as (1 - 83/1000) * 100 = 91.7. The QoS for cloud is calculated as (1 - 666/1000) * 100 = 33.4. However, since the car is making a loud squealing noise and there is smoke coming from the hood, I should use quality as a multiplier because this is also a very serious and quality-critical event. For edge, the score would thus be 91.7 * 0.4281 = 39.25. For cloud the score would thus be 33.4 * 0.8689 = 29.02. This is based on a pure multiplication approach given the importance of speed. However, since the prompt specifies focusing on latency if time-critical and quality if response-quality critical, I will create a new weighted average. Given this is time critical, we want to weigh latency as 80% and quality as 20% for both the edge and cloud. For edge: (1-(83/1000))*100 * 0.8 + 0.4281 * 100 * 0.2 = 79.19. For cloud: (1-(666/1000))*100 * 0.8 + 0.8689 * 100 * 0.2 = 76.84. In this case, because the edge has a lower latency and reasonable quality score it is preferable when time is of the essence."

However, since the question is about immediate action, the quality of the response is also important. The cloud response has a significantly higher quality score (0.7194) compared to the edge (0.4344).

Therefore, the QoS score heavily prioritizes latency. For edge, the latency is 123ms and quality is 0.4708. For cloud, the latency is 525ms and quality is 0.6381. Based on the critical need for a fast response, edge is significantly favored. The edge QoS is calculated as 0.7 * (1 - (123 - 100) / (500 - 100)) + 0.3 * 0.4708 = 0.7 * (1 - 0.0575) + 0.14124 = 0.7 * 0.9425 + 0.14124 = 0.65975 + 0.14124 = 0.80099 * 100 = 80.099. Cloud QoS is 0.7 * (1 - (525 - 100) / (500 - 100)) + 0.3 * 0.6381 = 0.7 * (1 - 1.0625) + 0.19143 = 0.7 * (-0.0625) + 0.19143 = -0.04375 + 0.19143 = 0.14768 * 100 = 14.768. I will adjust the formula to ensure the scores are within [0,100]. Given the extreme urgency, I will prioritize latency much more, e.g., 90% latency, 10% quality for time-critical. A latency under 200 ms is very good, under 500 ms acceptable, over 500 ms bad for time critical queries. For edge, 123ms is excellent. For cloud, 525ms is bad. QoS for edge: (1 - (123-100)/400) * 0.9 + 0.4708 * 0.1 = (1 - 0.0575) * 0.9 + 0.04708 = 0.9425 * 0.9 + 0.04708 = 0.84825 + 0.04708 = 0.89533. Or, for the purpose of easier calculation, let me define good latency as 100ms (score 100), acceptable as 250ms (score 70), and bad as 500ms (score 0). So, edge: 123ms is closer to 100ms. I can do a linear interpolation for latency score: 100 - (123-100)/(250-100) * (100-70) = 100 - 23/150 * 30 = 100 - 4.6 = 95.4. Then quality is 0.4708 * 100 = 47.08. Weighted QoS = 0.9 * 95.4 + 0.1 * 47.08 = 85.86 + 4.708 = 90.568. Let me further simplify it. Given it is a very time critical problem, latency is the most important factor. The edge latency of 123ms is very good, so it gets a high score. The cloud latency of 525ms is quite bad for a time critical request. The quality scores are not strong for either, but given the time sensitive nature, the speed is paramount. I"

Therefore, the QoS score should primarily reflect latency. For edge, a latency of 108ms is good, and a quality score of 0.5944 is acceptable for an emergency. The QoS edge score is calculated as 0.7 * (1 - (108 / 1000)) * 100 + 0.3 * (0.5944 * 100) = 0.7 * 0.892 * 100 + 0.3 * 59.44 = 62.44 + 17.83 = 80.27. For cloud, a latency of 810ms is very high for an emergency, and a quality of 0.6666, while better, does not compensate for the delay. The QoS cloud score is calculated as 0.7 * (1 - (810 / 1000)) * 100 + 0.3 * (0.6666 * 100) = 0.7 * 0.19 * 100 + 0.3 * 66.66 = 13.3 + 19.998 = 33.298. Given the critical nature of the prompt, a higher weighting (70%) is placed on inverse normalized latency and a lower weighting (30%) on quality for the QoS calculation.

I will re-adjust the overall scale and use a different approach based on direct evaluation. Edge latency 108ms is very good. Edge quality 0.5944 is acceptable. This is a life-critical scenario. Prioritize speed heavily. For edge: Score will be high due to low latency. (1 - (108/1000)) * 100 = 89.2. Quality contributes less, but positively. For cloud: latency 810ms is very bad for this instruction. (1 - (810/1000)) * 100 = 19. Quality 0.6666 is good but cannot overcome the latency. A simple model: for edge, given 108ms latency, 1000ms is the max acceptable, so (1 - 108/1000)*100 = 89.2. For cloud, given 810ms latency, (1 - 810/1000)*100 = 19. This is primarily a latency-critical task. I will consider the quality score as a minor boost to the latency score.

While the edge quality score (0.6911) is lower than the cloud (0.8216), the difference in quality is not as crucial as the difference in response time when a car is on fire. 

QoS for Edge: Given the high time criticality, the excellent latency of 108ms is heavily weighted. A score of 75 reflects the strong advantage of edge computing here.

QoS for Cloud: The cloud latency of 782ms is unacceptably high for this emergency. Although the quality is better, it does not compensate for the delay. A score of 25 reflects the poor suitability of the cloud for this specific instruction."
