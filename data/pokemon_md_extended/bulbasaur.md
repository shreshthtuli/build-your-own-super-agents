*Bulbasaur* is a [Grass](/type/grass)/[Poison](/type/poison) type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

*Bulbasaur* is a small, mainly turquoise amphibian Pokémon with red eyes and a green bulb on its back. It is based on a frog/toad, with the bulb resembling a plant bulb that grows into a flower as it evolves.

*Bulbasaur* is notable for being the very first Pokémon in the National Pokédex. It is one of the three choices for a "starter Pokémon" in the original Game Boy games, Pokémon Red & Blue (Red & Green in Japan), along with [Charmander](/pokedex/charmander) and [Squirtle](/pokedex/squirtle).
