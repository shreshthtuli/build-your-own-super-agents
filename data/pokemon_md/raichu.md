## Pokédex entries

### Raichu

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Red Blue | Its long tail serves as a ground to protect itself from its own high voltage power. |
| Yellow | When electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes feisty. It also glows in the dark. |
| Gold | When its electricity builds, its muscles are stimulated, and it becomes more aggressive than usual. |
| Silver | If the electric pouches in its cheeks become fully charged, both ears will stand straight up. |
| Crystal | If its electric pouches run empty, it raises its tail to gather electricity from the atmosphere. |
| Ruby | If the electrical sacks become excessively charged, RAICHU plants its tail in the ground and discharges. Scorched patches of ground will be found near this POKéMON’s nest. |
| Sapphire | This POKéMON exudes a weak electrical charge from all over its body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness. RAICHU searches for electricity by planting its tail in the ground. |
| FireRed | Its electric charges can reach even 100,000 volts. Careless contact can cause even an Indian elephant to faint. |
| LeafGreen | Its long tail serves as a ground to protect itself from its own high-voltage power. |
| Emerald | If it stores too much electricity, its behavior turns aggressive. To avoid this, it occasionally discharges excess energy and calms itself down. |
| Diamond | It turns aggressive if it has too much electricity in its body. It discharges power through its tail. |
| Pearl | It can loose 100,000-volt bursts of electricity, instantly downing foes several times its size. |
| Platinum | Its tail discharges electricity into the ground, protecting it from getting shocked. |
| HeartGold | When its electricity builds, its muscles are stimulated, and it becomes more aggressive than usual. |
| SoulSilver | If the electric pouches in its cheeks become fully charged, both ears will stand straight up. |
| Black White Black 2 White 2 | Its tail discharges electricity into the ground, protecting it from getting shocked. |
| X | When its electricity builds, its muscles are stimulated, and it becomes more aggressive than usual. |
| Y | It can loose 100,000-volt bursts of electricity, instantly downing foes several times its size. |
| Omega Ruby | If the electrical sacs become excessively charged, Raichu plants its tail in the ground and discharges. Scorched patches of ground will be found near this Pokémon’s nest. |
| Alpha Sapphire | This Pokémon exudes a weak electrical charge from all over its body that makes it take on a slight glow in darkness. Raichu plants its tail in the ground to discharge electricity. |
| Sun | It unleashes electric shocks that can reach 100,000 volts. When agitated, it can knock out even an Indian elephant. |
| Moon | It becomes aggressive when it has electricity stored up. At such times, even its Trainer has to take care to avoid being attacked. |
| Ultra Sun | As electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes more aggressive. One theory is that the electricity buildup is actually causing stress. |
| Ultra Moon | Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don’t see this Pokémon very often. |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | When electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes feisty. It also glows in the dark. |
| Sword | Its long tail serves as a ground to protect itself from its own high-voltage power. |
| Shield | If its electric pouches run empty, it raises its tail to gather electricity from the atmosphere. |
| Brilliant Diamond | It turns aggressive if it has too much electricity in its body. It discharges power through its tail. |
| Shining Pearl | It can loose 100,000-volt bursts of electricity, instantly downing foes several times its size. |
| Legends: Arceus | It can discharge bursts of electricity exceeding 100,000 volts— a single strike with that amount of power would incapacitate one of the Copperajah of my homeland. |
| Scarlet | Its tail discharges electricity into the ground, protecting it from getting shocked. |
| Violet | If the electric pouches in its cheeks become fully charged, both ears will stand straight up. |

### Alolan Raichu

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Sun | It only evolves to this form in the Alola region. According to researchers, its diet is one of the causes of this change. |
| Moon | It uses psychokinesis to control electricity. It hops aboard its own tail, using psychic power to lift the tail and move about while riding it. |
| Ultra Sun | It focuses psychic energy into its tail and rides it like it’s surfing. Another name for this Pokémon is “hodad.” |
| Ultra Moon | When you rub its cheeks, a sweet fragrance comes wafting out. However, you’ll also get a light shock! |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | It loves pancakes prepared with a secret Alolan recipe. Some wonder whether that recipe holds the key to this Pokémon’s evolution. |
| Sword | It’s believed that the weather, climate, and food of the Alola region all play a part in causing Pikachu to evolve into this form of Raichu. |
| Shield | This Pokémon rides on its tail while it uses its psychic powers to levitate. It attacks with star-shaped thunderbolts. |
