*Charizard* is a [Fire](/type/fire)/[Flying](/type/flying) type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1.

*Charizard* is a large dragon-like Pokémon, mainly orange in color. It has two large wings, the underside of which are turquoise. Like Charmander and Charmeleon, it has a flame at the end of its tail.

The design of *Charizard* appears to draw inspiration from dragons of European folklore, with its large wings, horned head, and fiery breath.

*Charizard* is notable for being the final evolution stage of one of the original "starter Pokémon", along with [Venusaur](/pokedex/venusaur) and [Blastoise](/pokedex/blastoise). Although it looks like a dragon, it doesn't have the Dragon typing. However it has two Mega Evolutions, available in Generation 6 games and [Pokémon Go](/go), one of which replaces its Flying type with Dragon. *Charizard* also has a Gigantamax form available in Pokémon Sword/Shield, with an exclusive G-Max move, [G-Max Wildfire](/move/g-max-wildfire).
