| --- | --- |
| Gold | It is not yet skilled at storing electricity. It may send out a jolt if amused or startled. |
| Silver | Despite its small size, it can zap even adult humans. However, if it does so, it also surprises itself. |
| Crystal | It is unskilled at storing electric power. Any kind of shock causes it to discharge energy spontaneously. |
| Ruby | PICHU charges itself with electricity more easily on days with thunderclouds or when the air is very dry. You can hear the crackling of static electricity coming off this POKéMON. |
| Sapphire | When PICHU plays with others, it may short out electricity with another PICHU, creating a shower of sparks. In that event, this POKéMON will begin crying, startled by the flash of sparks. |
| FireRed | Despite its small size, it can zap even adult humans. However, if it does so, it also surprises itself. |
| LeafGreen | It is not yet skilled at storing electricity. It may send out a jolt if amused or startled. |
| Emerald | It is still inept at retaining electricity. When it is startled, it discharges power accidentally. It gets better at holding power as it grows older. |
| Diamond | The electric pouches on its cheeks are still small. They cannot store much electricity yet. |
| Pearl | It plays with others by touching tails and setting off sparks. This appears to be a test of courage. |
| Platinum | The electric sacs in its cheeks are small. If even a little electricity leaks, it becomes shocked. |
| HeartGold | It is not yet skilled at storing electricity. It may send out a jolt if amused or startled. |
| SoulSilver | Despite its small size, it can zap even adult humans. However, if it does so, it also surprises itself. |
| Black White Black 2 White 2 | The electric sacs in its cheeks are small. If even a little electricity leaks, it becomes shocked. |
| X | It plays with others by touching tails and setting off sparks. This appears to be a test of courage. |
| Y | It is not yet skilled at storing electricity. It may send out a jolt if amused or startled. |
| Omega Ruby | Pichu charges itself with electricity more easily on days with thunderclouds or when the air is very dry. You can hear the crackling of static electricity coming off this Pokémon. |
| Alpha Sapphire | When Pichu plays with others, it may short out electricity with another Pichu, creating a shower of sparks. In that event, this Pokémon will begin crying, startled by the flash of sparks. |
| Sun | It is not yet skilled at controlling electricity. If you take your eyes off it, it may shock itself. |
| Moon | Despite this Pokémon’s cute appearance, those who want to live with one should prepare to be on the receiving end of its electric jolts. |
| Ultra Sun | It still can’t use electricity well. When it’s surprised or excited, it discharges electricity unintentionally. |
| Ultra Moon | It has electric sacs in its cheeks. When they’re fully charged, Pichu plays very energetically. |
| Sword | Despite its small size, it can zap even adult humans. However, if it does so, it also surprises itself. |
| Shield | The electric sacs in its cheeks are small. If even a little electricity leaks, it becomes shocked. |
| Brilliant Diamond | The electric sacs on its cheeks are still small. They cannot store much electricity yet. |
| Shining Pearl | It plays with others by touching tails and setting off sparks. This appears to be a test of courage. |
| Legends: Arceus | Pichu stores electricity in the sacs on its cheeks but discharges it inadvertently when agitated or excited. Being yet immature, the Pokémon’s handling of electricity is rather inept. |
| Scarlet | It is unskilled at storing electric power. Any kind of shock causes it to discharge energy spontaneously. |
| Violet | Despite this Pokémon’s cute appearance, those who want to live with one should prepare to be on the receiving end of its electric jolts. |
