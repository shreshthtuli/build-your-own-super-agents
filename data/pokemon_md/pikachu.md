## Pokédex entries

### Pikachu

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Red Blue | When several of these POKéMON gather, their electricity could build and cause lightning storms. |
| Yellow | It keeps its tail raised to monitor its surroundings. If you yank its tail, it will try to bite you. |
| Gold | This intelligent POKéMON roasts hard BERRIES with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. |
| Silver | It raises its tail to check its surroundings. The tail is sometimes struck by lightning in this pose. |
| Crystal | When it is angered, it immediately discharges the energy stored in the pouches in its cheeks. |
| Ruby | Whenever PIKACHU comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it’s evidence that this POKéMON mistook the intensity of its charge. |
| Sapphire | This POKéMON has electricity-storing pouches on its cheeks. These appear to become electrically charged during the night while PIKACHU sleeps. It occasionally discharges electricity when it is dozy after waking up. |
| FireRed | It has small electric sacs on both its cheeks. If threatened, it looses electric charges from the sacs. |
| LeafGreen | When several of these POKéMON gather, their electricity can build and cause lightning storms. |
| Emerald | It stores electricity in the electric sacs on its cheeks. When it releases pent-up energy in a burst, the electric power is equal to a lightning bolt. |
| Diamond | It lives in forests with others. It stores electricity in the pouches on its cheeks. |
| Pearl | If it looses crackling power from the electric pouches on its cheeks, it is being wary. |
| Platinum | It occasionally uses an electric shock to recharge a fellow PIKACHU that is in a weakened state. |
| HeartGold | This intelligent Pokémon roasts hard berries with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. |
| SoulSilver | It raises its tail to check its surroundings. The tail is sometimes struck by lightning in this pose. |

| Alpha Sapphire | This Pokémon has electricity-storing pouches on its cheeks. These appear to become electrically charged during the night while Pikachu sleeps. It occasionally discharges electricity when it is dozy after waking up. |
| Sun | A plan was recently announced to gather many Pikachu and make an electric power plant. |
| Moon | It’s in its nature to store electricity. It feels stressed now and then if it’s unable to fully discharge the electricity. |
| Ultra Sun | Its nature is to store up electricity. Forests where nests of Pikachu live are dangerous, since the trees are so often struck by lightning. |
| Ultra Moon | While sleeping, it generates electricity in the sacs in its cheeks. If it’s not getting enough sleep, it will be able to use only weak electricity. |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | This forest-dwelling Pokémon stores electricity in its cheeks, so you’ll feel a tingly shock if you touch it. |
| Sword | Pikachu that can generate powerful electricity have cheek sacs that are extra soft and super stretchy. |
| Shield | When Pikachu meet, they’ll touch their tails together and exchange electricity through them as a form of greeting. |
