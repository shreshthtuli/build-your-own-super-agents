## Pokédex entries

### Slowpoke

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Red Blue | Incredibly slow and dopey. It takes 5 seconds for it to feel pain when under attack. |
| Yellow | Incredibly slow and sluggish. It is quite content to loll about without worrying about the time. |
| Gold | It lazes vacantly near water. If something bites its tail, it won’t even notice for a whole day. |
| Silver | A sweet sap leaks from its tail’s tip. Although not nutritious, the tail is pleasant to chew on. |
| Crystal | It is always so absent-minded that it won’t react, even if its flavorful tail is bitten. |
| Ruby Sapphire | SLOWPOKE uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this POKéMON often forgets what it’s doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water’s edge. |
| FireRed | It is always vacantly lost in thought, but no one knows what it is thinking about. It is good at fishing with its tail. |
| LeafGreen | Incredibly slow and dopey. It takes five seconds for it to feel pain when under attack. |
| Emerald | It catches prey by dipping its tail in water at the side of a river. But it often forgets what it is doing and spends entire days just loafing at water’s edge. |
| Diamond Pearl Platinum | Although slow, it is skilled at fishing with its tail. It does not feel pain if its tail is bitten. |
| HeartGold | It lazes vacantly near water. If something bites its tail, it won’t even notice for a whole day. |
| SoulSilver | A sweet sap leaks from its tail’s tip. Although not nutritious, the tail is pleasant to chew on. |
| Black White Black 2 White 2 | Although slow, it is skilled at fishing with its tail. It does not feel pain if its tail is bitten. |
| X | It is always vacantly lost in thought, but no one knows what it is thinking about. It is good at fishing with its tail. |
| Y | It lazes vacantly near water. If something bites its tail, it won’t even notice for a whole day. |
| Omega Ruby Alpha Sapphire | Slowpoke uses its tail to catch prey by dipping it in water at the side of a river. However, this Pokémon often forgets what it’s doing and often spends entire days just loafing at water’s edge. |
| Sun | Its long tail often breaks off. It doesn’t really feel any pain, though, and the tail grows back, so Slowpoke isn’t particularly bothered. |
| Moon | Alolan home cooking involves drying Slowpoke tails and then simmering them into a salty stew. |
| Ultra Sun | There are some places where Slowpoke is worshiped because of a long-standing belief that whenever Slowpoke yawns, it rains. |
| Ultra Moon | Although their tails, which fall off naturally, can easily be found lying around, they’re a precious ingredient for cooking. |
| Let's Go Pikachu Let's Go Eevee | Incredibly slow and sluggish. It is quite content to loll about without worrying about the time. |
| Sword | Slow-witted and oblivious, this Pokémon won’t feel any pain if its tail gets eaten. It won’t notice when its tail grows back, either. |
| Shield | When this Pokémon’s tail is soaked in water, sweetness seeps from it. Slowpoke uses this trait to lure in and fish up other Pokémon. |
| Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl | Although slow, it is skilled at fishing with its tail. It does not feel pain if its tail is bitten. |
| Scarlet | It is incredibly slow and dopey. It takes five seconds for it to feel pain when under attack. |
| Violet | It is always vacantly lost in thought, but no one knows what it is thinking about. It is good at fishing with its tail. |

### Galarian Slowpoke

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Sword | Although this Pokémon is normally zoned out, its expression abruptly sharpens on occasion. The cause for this seems to lie in Slowpoke’s diet. |
| Shield | Because Galarian Slowpoke eat the seeds of a plant that grows only in Galar, their tails have developed a spicy flavor. |
