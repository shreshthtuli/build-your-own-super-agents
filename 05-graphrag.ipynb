    "# 05. Knowledge Graphs and GraphRAG\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course, we’ve explored **traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — a paradigm where large language models retrieve **unstructured text chunks** from vector databases (like FAISS or LanceDB) and synthesize answers on-the-fly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While RAG works well for surface-level question answering, it **struggles with structure, reasoning, and relationships**. It treats text as isolated passages — not as **entities** linked by meaning or causality.  That’s where **Knowledge Graphs** and **GraphRAG** step in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why Knowledge Graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Knowledge Graph (KG)** represents knowledge as **nodes (entities)** and **edges (relationships)**, creating a structured and interpretable memory.  \n",
    "In contrast to flat vector retrieval, KGs allow an agent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reason symbolically** — follow explicit paths like *“Pichu → Pikachu → Raichu”*.  \n",
    "- **Disambiguate entities** — distinguish *Thunderbolt (move)* vs *Thunderbolt (item)*.  \n",
    "- **Fuse multi-source facts** — merging structured and unstructured evidence.  \n",
    "- **Explain answers** — show the exact graph edges used in reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields an AI system that is not only more **precise** but also **auditable** and **less hallucinatory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GraphRAG** blends the strengths of retrieval and structured reasoning:\n",
    "1. **Retrieve** relevant context → turn it into triples (`(subject, predicate, object)`).\n",
    "2. **Store / update** these triples in a **graph backend** (persistent memory).  \n",
    "3. **Reason on the graph** to answer complex or multi-hop queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, **GraphRAG = RAG + Knowledge Graph Reasoning**. Instead of searching documents, we query the graph — traversing relationships explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Enter Graphiti + FalkorDB\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use the [**Graphiti**](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) library — a lightweight, production-grade framework for building **temporal knowledge graphs** that integrate directly with LLMs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**FalkorDB** is a **high-performance graph database** built on Redis, which we use as the backend for Graphiti. It combines the **speed of in-memory databases** with **Cypher-style graph queries**, making it perfect for real-time AI agents that need to evolve their graph dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphiti uses structured outputs from LLMs to **extract triples**, **store them as graph edges**, and **enable reasoning** through its built-in query APIs and MCP server. Together, Graphiti + FalkorDB create the ideal playground for **GraphRAG agents** — ones that can remember, reason, and adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, let's first start with what it takes to create graphical data. "

    "### 🧩 Define the Schema and Create a Triple-Extraction Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can build a knowledge graph, we need to define **what relationships are allowed**.  \n",
    "We’ll describe our Pokémon world using a small, fixed schema of predicates such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HAS_TYPE` — connects a Pokémon to its elemental type  \n",
    "- `EVOLVES_TO` — shows evolution paths  \n",
    "- `NEEDS_ITEM` — evolution dependency (e.g., Thunder Stone)  \n",
    "- `LEARNS_MOVE` — captures learnable moves  \n",
    "- `WEAK_AGAINST`, `RESISTS` — for type matchups  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this schema, we’ll create two **Pydantic models**:\n",
    "1. `Triple` — represents one edge (`subject`, `predicate`, `object`)  \n",
    "2. `BuildKGResult` — wraps the list of extracted entities and triples  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we’ll define a **PydanticAI Agent** called `builder` that takes raw episode text and returns structured triples according to our schema.  \n",
    "This mimics how an information-extraction LLM in Graphiti works under the hood — but here we do it manually for clarity.\n"
