    "# 02. Moving to a Framework: PydanticAI\n",
    "\n",
    "In tutorial 01 we wired up a bare-bones agent manually. However, all the engineering around the agent, tools and memory can be offloaded to an Agentic framework. Agentic frameworks like [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) or [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) simplify this by turning LLMs into structured, stateful agents that can:\n",
    "- **Reason** → generate thoughts or plans.\n",
    "- **Act** → call functions or tools safely.\n",
    "- **Remember** → maintain state across steps.\n",
    "- **Validate** → ensure model responses follow predefined schemas automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, they make the “LLM + tools + memory” loop *modular* and *robust*.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) provides:\n",
    "- **Automatic JSON validation** via Pydantic models.  \n",
    "- **Cleaner syntax** — you define structure, not glue code.  \n",
    "- **Built-in model orchestration** with minimal setup.  \n",
    "- **Extensible memory and reasoning controls** for larger agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This transition will help you focus on **designing intelligent behaviors**, not wiring model calls.  We'll keep the examples compact so you can focus on the core ideas, while also mapping each topic back to the official documentation so you can dig deeper on your own. Let's extend our Agentic AI knowledge to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How the core `Agent` API maps to models, prompts, and run results.\n",
    "- How to register tools, inject dependencies, and read the `RunContext`.\n",
    "- How to add structured outputs, guardrails (validation + redaction), and retries.\n",
    "- How to stream responses and log the conversation with Logfire.\n",
    "- How to glue everything together in a realistic concierge use-case.\n",
    "- Where to find each concept inside the [PydanticAI docs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/).\n"

    "- `deps_type`: (Optional) A Pydantic model describing the structured dependencies your tools need.\n",
    "- `result_type`: (Optional) A Pydantic model that constrains the final answer.\n",
    "- `tools`: (Optional) A list of callables registered ahead of time. You can also decorate functions with `@agent.tool` as shown later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `Agent` offers synchronous (`run_sync`) and asynchronous (`run`) helpers that return a [`RunResult`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/results/#runresult). We'll use the sync variants to keep the tutorial focused. We also use OpenRouter provider by explicitly specifying `openrourter:` in the model argument."

It’s a stylish, spacious spot loved by locals — great for coffee, avocado toast, and pastries. Afterward, head to **Museum Island**. Though the museums open early, the highlight today is the **late-night opening** (which also means fewer crowds and extended hours if you plan your visit smartly). Focus on the Pergamon Museum or the Altes Museum — immersive for teens who like history or art. Bring a sketchbook if anyone enjoys doodling artifacts!\\n\\n**Afternoon:**\\nStroll through the beautiful Berlin Cathedral grounds and cross the River Spree toward **Kreuzberg**. Grab your lunch at **Markthalle Neun** — this indoor food hall is a teen magnet with global street food stalls. Try a Korean taco, vegan ramen, or Brooklyn-style pizza. After eating, wander Kreuzberg’s vibrant street art alleys (especially around Oranienstraße), then head to the **Saturday Street Food Market** (12–6 PM), where live music, colorful stalls, and ice cream treats keep everyone happy.\\n\\n**Evening:**\\nUnwind with a **Spree River Sunset Boat Cruise** (book ahead — sunset around 7:30 PM this time of year).floating past landmarks like the Reichstag, Berlin Cathedral, and TV Tower under golden light is magical. End the night back in Kreuzberg with soft-serve ice cream from a retro stall, or grab a late bite at the legendary **Mustafas Gemüse Kebap** — a Berlin institution that’s perfect for sharing fries and kebabs under string lights.\\n\\nIt’s a day full of energy, flavor, and local flavor — exactly what Berlin does best for families.',\n",
